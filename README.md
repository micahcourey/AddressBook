Address Book

Code Review for Epicodus, 08.07.2015

By Micah Courey

Description

This is a address book web app built in PHP using the Silex framework and Twig template engine. A user can add new contacts to the address by typing in the contacts name, phone number and address. They will next be taken to a page displaying the contact information they entered with a link back to the main page which will display any contacts they have entered as well as the form to enter more contacts. There is a clear button at the bottom of the page to clear all contacts from the address book which will take you to a page that tells you that the address book is cleared.
